    "# Predicting heart-disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notbook looks into using various python based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attrbutes.\n",

    "The original data came from the cleavland data from the UCI mahine learning repository.http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",

    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we will purse the project.\n",
